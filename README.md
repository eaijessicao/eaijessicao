## Hey! I'm Jessica de Oliveira üñêÔ∏è

Hello, I'm Jessica and I'm 22 years old. I've been working with technology since I was young, fixing cell phones and computers for friends and neighbors. I have around 1 year of experience in web development. I worked for a company called Golab for about 6 months, where I gained knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, MWTPL, and SEO. Currently, I'm studying Python and looking for an internship opportunity to improve my skills. I'm a fast learner with good communication skills, always willing to learn new things and help out where needed.
